# <Random-Password-Generator>

## Description

In this project, I modified starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password length is chosen by the user (between 8 and 128 characters) and can include lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and/or special characters.
